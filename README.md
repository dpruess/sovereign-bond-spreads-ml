This repository contains the code, data, and results from my bachelor thesis:
"Predicting Sovereign Bond Spreads: Empirical Analyses using Machine Learning Techniques."

In this study, I apply Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) to predict 10-year sovereign bond spreads in the Euro area (2007â€“2023). The models leverage macroeconomic, financial, and monetary policy variables to uncover non-linear relationships in bond spreads.
