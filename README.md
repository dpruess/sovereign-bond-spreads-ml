This repository contains the code, data, and results from my bachelor thesis: Predicting Sovereign Bond Spreads: Empirical Analyses using Machine Learning Techniques.

This study applies Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) to predict 10-year sovereign bond spreads in the Euro area (2007-2023). The models analyze macroeconomic, financial, and monetary policy variables to capture non-linear relationships in bond spreads.
